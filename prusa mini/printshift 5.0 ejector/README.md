### Lift the bed up
 - 6 Hex Standoffs - female threaded 5mm or 4.5mm hex standoff 10mm long.  Source: https://www.mcmaster.com/94868A166/
 - 6 flat head screws - M3 by 8mm long, yes you could re-use Prusa's original ones but they're short and torx, which annoys me.  Source: https://www.mcmaster.com/91304A101/

### Drive Roller and Idler Mounting
 - 4 bearings - MR148-2RS Deep Groove Ball Bearings 8mm Inner Dia 14mm OD 4mm thick
 - 2 8mm by 200mm long hardened steel shafts.
 - 1 ~160mm EPDM rubber sleeve - 5/16 or 8mm in diameter, wall thickness 1/16" or 1.5mm or less.  Source: https://www.mcmaster.com/9776T15/
   - This provides grip to drive the belt.  1mm adhesive EPDM foam sheet works, too, but it's a pain to apply it smoothly.

### Clutch
 - 1 8mm Needle Roller Bearing, One Way Clutch 8mm Bore 14mm OD 12mm Width

### Tension the Belt
 - 2 M3 square nuts
 - 2 M3 screws, 15mm long

### The Belt itself!
 - .2mm thick Kapton film
   - 155mm wide, 430mm long. Source: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2255800287123252.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.0.0.3e4c1802e5Lrmy&gatewayAdapt=4itemAdapt
   - 1 meter of film should get you 6 belts 
   - There's a jig for making these in the Prusa Mini directory
 - super thin PET tape.  Source: https://www.mcmaster.com/7630A175/
   - This is the best tape I've found.  It still tends to get damaged when printed on, so I time the motor to do a single revolution and don't print on the seam.
 - NEW: magnetic stainless steel shim stock, 6" wide: https://www.mcmaster.com/9500K101/
